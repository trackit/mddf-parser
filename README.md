# MEC/MMC Parser

This is a TypeScript library that provides tools for parsing XML data from MEC and MMC files of MovieLabs. It follows the XML schema definitions provided by MovieLabs for these files.

With this library, you can extract information about studios, films, and TV shows from MovieLabs metadata files and use it in your application.

## Key Features

- Parses MEC and MMC XML files into TypeScript interfaces that follow MovieLabs XML schema definitions.
- Written in TypeScript for type-safety and ease of use in TypeScript projects.

# About

MEC (Media Entertainment Core) and MMC (Media Manifest Core) files are XML files that contain metadata on movies and TV shows, including title, actors, directors, producers, studios, and distributors. They are used to help with distribution, sales, and promotion of these contents.

However, accessing these data can be challenging for developers without the proper tools to extract and use them. This is where our library comes in. By converting these XML files into TypeScript interfaces, developers can access and manipulate these data more easily in their projects.
